# 2022-10-23: A2 planning

Time: 2pm - 3pm

Note taker: Cynthia

Agenda:

- assign tasks for progress for A2
- decide on front-end and back-end progress

## The questions we've decided on for this data set before:

Question 1: What’s the correlation between salary and department or industry of work?

- To be visualized using Chart.js: Bar Chart
    - https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/bar.html


Question 2: What’s the correlation between benefits and total compensation?
- To be visualized using Chart.js: Line Chart
    - https://www.chartjs.org/docs/latest/charts/line.html



## How to visualize the website:

1. **Dashboard (decided on this)**
    - Example look: ![](https://i.imgur.com/UQNSsXi.png)
    - Library we can use: React Grid https://npmtrends.com/golden-layout-vs-gridstack-vs-gridster-vs-react-grid-layout
    
2. List format

## Testing

### Backend testing

For now, we'll focus on adding tests for controllers to make sure the data we're passing to frontend is correct.

### Do we need frontend testing?

- End to end test: no
    - reason: we don't expect to have any user interaction at all

- component snapshot test: no
    - reason: we expect to have every component on the main page, and the dev can easily load up the page to view changes. The scope of the project isn't big enough for visual regression to occur.
