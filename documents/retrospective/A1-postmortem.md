# A1 postmortem

Date: 2022-11-04

## What goals have been achieved?
- setup repository and commands to run the app
- setup frontend and backend skeletons
- setup basic testing
- scheduling meetings regularly and documenting our plans and achievements


## What goals have been missed, by how much?
- no goal that was outlined in A1 was missed.



## How plans will need to be adjusted, based on remaining time available and project scope.

In terms of process, we ran into issues with scheduling regular meetings due to team members being sick or having conflicts with assignments from other courses. We originally planned for some task syncs to be asynchronous, but found that going over a week without a proper sync tends to lead to no progress. The current plan is to have more short meetings and using when2meet.com to avoid scheduling conflicts.

In terms of product, we didn't encounter any roadblocks during the development of A1, as every member had domain expertise in at least one of the following: frontend, backend, CI/CD and database. 



## What, if any, adjustments or decisions need to be made in light of what we have learned about project scope and capacity since.

We will be actively managing the task board so that the nice-to-have will not be prioritized above the must-have, and ensure that towards the end of the assignment, the features we've developed are in a demo-able state.
