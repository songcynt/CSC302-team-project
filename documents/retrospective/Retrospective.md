### What goals have been achieved?

- Backend structure with routing and database connection
- Frontend visualization with the necessary libraries
- API testing
- Documentation (developer setup, meeting notes, etc)

### What goals have been missed, by how much?
- Working setup of installation scripts
    - Didn't properly check docker-compose setup (had typo)
- Clean documentation
    - some documentation were written last minute and could've been cleaned up before submitting

### How plans were adjusted, in light of that information, including goals or features that were dropped, what other changes were made and why.
- Kubernetes implementation (optional milestone)
- Simulated Front-end Testing - not really testable with simple one-page front-end
- new tasks such as adding new questions to the list of questions we can answer, followd by implementation
- decide on structure/rules for dependencies (yarn vs npm, install dependencies in node modules in root vs server/frontend folders)

### Pros
- satisfied with deliverable (got 15/15) ++
- fair amount of work was distributed to each team member and was carried out as scheduled.

### Cons

- scheduling meeting was difficult +
    - some team members had last minute conflicts so we had to reschedule, but rescheduling meetings kept getting pushed

### Plan for improvement
- need better formating of meeting notes
- we've already implemented (we've switched to discord server instead of group chat and added a bot for reminders), but we've only used once
- should use When2Meet for scheduling more
