### Pros
- satisfied with deliverable (got 15/15) ++
- fair amount of work was distributed to each team member and was carried out as scheduled.

### Cons

- scheduling meeting was difficult +
    - some team members had last minute conflicts so we had to reschedule, but rescheduling meetings kept getting pushed

### Plan for improvement
- need better formating of meeting notes
- we've already implemented (we've switched to discord server instead of group chat and added a bot for reminders), but we've only used once
- should use When2Meet for scheduling more
